# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of **LabMateAI**, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing for mistakes, learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and public spaces where an individual is representing **LabMateAI** or its community. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at [support@labmateai.io](mailto:support@labmateai.io). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity about the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior is inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior.

- **Verify Accuracy**: Check that the API documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.

### **b. `installation.md`**

- **Installation Instructions**: Update the installation command to `pip install labmateai`.

- **Fix Broken Tests**: Address any failing tests due to the renaming.

## 3. Update Project Configuration Files

- **`.gitignore`**: Ensure it includes any new files or directories that need to be ignored.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Confirm that all dependencies are listed correctly and that no unnecessary packages are included.
- **`setup.cfg`** (if used): Update configurations to reflect the new package name and any other changes.

## 4. Update Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines

- **CI/CD Configurations**: If you're using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI, update configuration files to use the new package name.
- **Test Build Processes**: Ensure that the build and deployment pipelines work correctly after the changes.

## 5. Final Testing and Verification

- **End-to-End Testing**: Perform comprehensive testing of the package, including installation, usage, and edge cases.
- **Cross-Platform Checks**: If possible, test the package on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 6. Update the Project Website and Social Media

- **Website**: If you have a project website, update it to reflect the new name and branding.
- **Social Media**: Update any social media profiles or posts to inform followers about the name change.

## 7. Announce the Changes

- **Release Notes**: Create a new release on GitHub with detailed notes about the changes.
- **Community Announcement**: Inform existing users and contributors about the renaming and provide guidance on updating to the new package.

## 8. Update Badges and Shields in `README.md`

- **Build Status**: Update any CI/CD badges to point to the correct build pipelines.
- **PyPI Version**: Ensure the PyPI badge reflects the new package name.
- **License Badge**: Verify that the license badge is accurate.

## 9. Verify PyPI Project Details

- **Project Description**: Update the description, keywords, and other metadata on PyPI to reflect the new name and features.
- **Project URLs**: Ensure all links point to the correct locations (e.g., Homepage, Source Code, Bug Tracker).

## 10. Monitor for Issues

- **User Feedback**: Keep an eye on issues or discussions in your project's repository for any problems users might encounter due to the changes.
- **Quick Response**: Be prepared to address any issues promptly to ensure a smooth transition.
